Now, run the following commands inside first Terminal, which will start the ollama service inside google colab.
```ollama serve```
Create a new cell, open new terminal by again running the %xterm command same as above and the run the following command to pull an image of llama3.2-vision model from ollama library to your local machine.
This will download llama3.2-vision model having 11B parameters by default (model refer Here).
```ollama pull llama3.2-vision```
